1. Added Support for the `for` Loop

The `for` loop is a fundamental control structure in C, and adding support for it significantly enhances the compiler's functionality. The following changes were made:

- The `for` keyword was added to the list of recognized tokens and keywords.
- The compiler's parsing logic was updated to handle the syntax of the `for` loop, including its initialization, condition, and update expressions.
- Code generation was implemented to emit the necessary instructions for the `for` loop, including jumps and condition checks.

Impact: Programs can now use `for` loops, making the compiler more versatile and capable of handling a wider range of C programs.

2. Fixed Format Specifier Warnings

The original C4 compiler used `%d` as the format specifier in `printf` statements, which caused warnings because the `int` type was defined as `long long`. To resolve this:

- All instances of `%d` in `printf` statements were replaced with `%lld` to match the `long long` type.

Impact: The compiler no longer produces warnings related to format specifiers, and the output of `printf` statements is now correct.

3. Ensured the Modulus Operator (`%`) is Fully Functional

The modulus operator (`%`) was already supported in the original C4 compiler, but its functionality was confirmed and documented:

- The tokenizer recognizes the `%` symbol as the modulus operator.
- The virtual machine implements the modulus operation, allowing it to be used in expressions.

Impact: Programs can now use the modulus operator (`%`) to compute remainders, which is essential for many algorithms and calculations.

Conclusion

The modified C4 compiler (`c4_modified.c`) now supports the `for` loop, fixes format specifier warnings, and ensures the modulus operator works correctly. These changes make the compiler more feature-complete and suitable for compiling a wider range of C programs.
